Selecting Topic:
    The first thing to do about the assignment was finding suitable topic. I brainstormed for ideas and finally selected the topic - Startup idea evaluator. It takes various input from the user such as the startup idea , factors like Market size, technical feasibilty,competition, capital investment etc. The user also inputs the weights of each factor and rates each factor based on the idea.

Selecting Implementation and Tech stack:
    I decided to build a CLI using the language Python. The reason for choosing CLI was that it is easy to implement and the assigment was more about evaluating the thinking process than the beautified UI.

Pre Implementation:
    As a part before implementation I created an architecture diagram depicting the basic working of the system.
